        <p>I chose to selecte my city of Charlotte. It is not the capital of North Carolina but is the biggest city in the state. Its very interesting becasuse it is on the border of South Carolina and North Carolina. I actully live in South Carolina, but im in the suburb of Charlotte. You drive 5 minutes down the road and you're in a different state. </p>
